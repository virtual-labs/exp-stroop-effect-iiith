## Procedure

### Step 1: Starting the Experiment

- Launch the experiment.
- Press the **spacebar** to begin the task.

### Step 2: Viewing the Trials

- A word will appear on the screen in a specific color.
- Your task is to identify the **color of the word**, not its meaning.

### Step 3: Responding to the Color

- Press the key corresponding to the **color** of the word as quickly and accurately as possible, ignoring the word's meaning.  
  - Example:
    - If the word "RED" appears in red color, press the key for red.
    - If the word "RED" appears in blue color, press the key for blue.

### Step 4: Understanding Trial Types

- The experiment consists of three types of trials:
  - **Congruent Trials**: The word's meaning and color are the same (e.g., The word "RED" in red color).
  - **Incongruent Trials**: The word's meaning and color do not match (e.g., The word "RED" in blue color).
  - **Neutral Trials**: The word does not imply a color (e.g., The word "CHAIR" in green color).

### Step 5: Response Tracking

- The experiment will record your **response times** and **accuracy** for each trial.
