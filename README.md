<b> Experiment|     <b> Stroop Effect- Stroop Colour and Word Test

### About the Experiment 
This experiment aims to study the Stroop effect by using the Stroop color and word test. It would enable participants to see how automatic actions, such as reading, make it difficult to identify the color of a word when the meaning of the word and the color are in conflict. This experiment would therefore help us understand better cognitive processes like attention and control over responses.
