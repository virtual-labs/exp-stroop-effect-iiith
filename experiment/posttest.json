        "b": "Color-Color Stroop is a valid type, where both the color of the text and the background color are involved.",
        "c": "This is not a type of Stroop effect; Word-Word Stroop is not a recognized category.",

      "question": "You are standing at a T junction and looking for a direction signage board to find the location of building X. Though unknown to you, the actual location of the building is to your right. You happen to find a signage as follows. Which of the following direction board will help in making decision faster and more accurate? ",
      "answers": {
        "a": "<img src = 'images/q2a.jpg' />",
        "b": "<img src = 'images/q2b.jpg' />",

        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This image might lead to slower decision-making due to conflicting visual cues showing right indication but written left on the board.",
        "b": "This image provides a clearer direction, as it shows the actual location of the building, making the decision-making process faster and more accurate.",
        "c": "This is incorrect as only one image supports faster decision-making.",
        "d": "This is incorrect as one of the images does help in making a faster decision."

      "question": "What does the Stroop effect demonstrate?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The impact of font styles on reading speed.",
        "b": "The influence of word length on memory recall.",
        "c": "The interference between automatic word reading and color identification.",
        "d": "The relationship between word complexity and reading comprehension."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This is not correct. The Stroop effect is not about font styles and reading speed.",
        "b": "This is incorrect. The Stroop effect does not relate to word length or memory recall.",
        "c": "Correct! The Stroop effect demonstrates how automatic processes like reading words interfere with more controlled tasks like identifying colors.",
        "d": "This is not correct. The Stroop effect is not related to word complexity and reading comprehension."
