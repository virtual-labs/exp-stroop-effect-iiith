## Theory
 The Stroop effect is a psychological phenomenon that reveals how the brain processes conflicting information and how it affects our performance and reaction times. It shows that reading is such an automatic and fast process that it can interfere with other tasks that require more attention and control, such as identifying colors. The phenomenon of the Stroop effect is based on the idea that some cognitive processes are more automatic and faster than others, and that they can interfere with each other when they are in conflict. For example, reading is a skill that most people acquire at an early age and practice frequently, so it becomes an automatic and effortless process that does not require much attention or control. On the other hand, identifying colors is a less common and more complex task that requires more attention and control. Therefore, when the word and the color are incongruent, the automatic process of reading interferes with the controlled process of color naming, resulting in slower and less accurate responses. This interference is also influenced by other factors, such as the frequency and familiarity of the words, the similarity and contrast of the colors, the level of attention and motivation of the participants, and the context and instructions of the task.<br>
 The Stroop effect is usually demonstrated by the Stroop color and word test, which involves presenting participants with a series of color words (e.g., RED, BLUE) printed in different ink colors. The participants have to name the ink color of each word as quickly and accurately as possible, while ignoring the word itself. The words can be either congruent, meaning that the ink color matches the word (e.g., the word “RED” printed in red ink), or incongruent, meaning that the ink color does not match the word (e.g., the word “RED” printed in blue ink).<br>
 The theory behind the Stroop effect suggests that participants will experience more interference and slower reaction times when naming the ink color of incongruent words than when naming the ink color of congruent words. This is because reading the word is an automatic and unconscious process that happens faster than identifying the color, which requires more conscious and deliberate effort. Therefore, when the word and the color are incongruent, there is a conflict between the two processes that slows down the response and increases the chance of errors.<br>
 The Stroop effect was first described by American psychologist John Ridley Stroop in 1935, and has since become one of the most widely used and cited paradigms in cognitive psychology. It has been used to study various aspects of attention, perception, memory, language, emotion, and brain functioning.<br>
