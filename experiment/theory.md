## Theory
The Stroop Task is one of the best-known psychological experiments named after John Ridley Stroop.<br>
The Stroop effect refers to a delay in reaction times between congruent and incongruent stimuli.<br>
The Stroop phenomenon demonstrates that it is difficult to name the ink colour of a word written in colour if there is a mismatch between ink colour and word (incongruent). For example, the word GREEN printed in RED ink.
