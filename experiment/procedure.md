## Procedure
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
1) Participants will log in to the virtual lab website and access the Stroop effect experiment.
2) A series of trials will be presented on the screen, each consisting of a word displayed in a specific ink color.
3) Participants will be instructed to identify the ink color of the word by pressing the first letter on the keyboard as quickly and accurately as possible, while ignoring the word itself.
4) The experiment will include congruent trials, where the word and the ink color match (e.g., the word "RED" displayed in red ink),  incongruent trials, where the word and the ink color do not match (e.g., the word "RED" displayed in blue ink) and neutral trials, where the word is neutral to color(e.g., the word “CHAIR” in green ink).
5) Participants will respond by selecting the corresponding ink color from a set of response options provided on the screen.
6) The experiment will record response times and accuracy for each trial.
